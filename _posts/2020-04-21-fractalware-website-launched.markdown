I am happy to announce that we finally have a website!

It is still quite rough and we keep working on polishing it.

Both me and [Cody Richeson](/codyricheson/) don't have much experience with web development, however I have managed to find a solution that meets our requirements.  

This website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

While I have stumbled upon some issues when installing jekyll on my windows machine, it worked eventually. I was stuck trying to figure out why can't it build dependencies and apparently, one of the libraries (nokogiri) is not compatible with newest Ruby version. Thankfully, downgrade solved all the issues and let me build jekyll. I wish I did that much earlier however ;)
