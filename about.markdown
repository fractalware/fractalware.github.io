## WHAT IS FRACTALWARE?
Fractalware is a independend game development studio that began life in 2019. We are just two guys who met online in an indie developer group and began working remotely on apps and games. [Aleksander Ciesielski](/aleksanderciesielski/) does everything technology related and [Cody Richeson](/codyricheson/) does all the art and music. Our goal is to create engaging and unique games and programs.
